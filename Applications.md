# Introduction #
  * Definition of the graph Laplacian matrix: see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_matrix).
  * An excellent review of Laplacian applications appears in [D. Spielman's ICM 2010 paper](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/PAPERS/icm10post.pdf).

# Applications of the Graph Laplacian #

Laplacian matrices of graphs arise in
  * Large-scale computational applications such as machine learning
  * Spectral clustering of images, genetic data and web pages
  * Transportation network flows; electrical resistor circuits
  * Elliptic partial differential equations discretized on unstructured grids with finite elements.

The LAMG MATLAB code was demonstrated to scale linearly for a diverse set of 1666 real-world graphs from these applications with up to six million edges.
