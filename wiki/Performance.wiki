#summary LAMG software performance for a real-world graph collection.

The provided LAMG MATLAB implementation scaled linearly for a diverse set of 1680 real-world graphs with up to six million edges available at the [http://code.google.com/p/lamg/downloads/list Downloads] section. This multilevel methodology can be fully parallelized and extended to eigenvalue problems and other graph computations. 

See the [http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.0123 LAMG ArXiv technical report], section 4 for details.

= Summary Statistics =
All times are in seconds. Solve times are per significant figure. Total time = setup time + 10 * solve time (i.e., the runtime of a a single solve to 10 significant figures).
