#summary LAMG software performance for a real-world graph collection.

The provided LAMG MATLAB implementation scaled linearly for a diverse set of 1666 real-world graphs with up to six million edges. This multilevel methodology can be fully parallelized and extended to eigenvalue problems and other graph computations. 

See the [http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.0123 LAMG ArXiv technical report], section 4 for details.

More details and figures TBA here.
