#summary Examples of running LAMG in MATLAB.

=Basic Example=
<a ref="#usage">
{{{
% Construct a solver
lamg = Lamg();

% Create a graph adjacency matrix A. Note: g.laplacian is the corresponding
% Laplacian matrix.
g = Graphs.grid('fd', [20 20]);
A = g.symAdjacency;

% Setup phase: construct a LAMG multi-level hierarchy
setup = lamg.setup(A);  % Or setup = lamg.setup(g);

% Solve phase: set up a compatible RHS b (remember: A is singular) and
% solve A*x=b
b = (1:size(A,1))';
b = b - mean(b);
[x, details] = lamg.linearSolve(setup, b);

=Customizing the Algorithm=
LAMG is supposed to be a black-box solver, so in most cases you don't need to tweak any options!

If you do need to, all options are attributes of the class `amg.api.Options` and described therein. You can pass key-value pairs at the end of the `Lamg()`, `Lamg.setup()` and Lamg.solve()` calls. Examples:
{{{
% Measure convergence in the residual L2 norm.
% Options passed to the constructor are used by both the setup and solve phases.
lamg = Lamg('errorNorm', @errorNormResidual);

% Stop coarsening when the graph has less than 200 edges
setup = lamg.setup(A, 'maxDirectSolverSize', 200);

% Solve A*x=b to 8 significant figures
[x, details] = lamg.linearSolve(setup, b, 'errorReductionTol', 1e-8);
