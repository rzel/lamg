#summary Application of Laplacian Matrices.

Definition of a Laplacian matrix: see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_matrix Wikipedia].

= Laplacian Applications =

An excellent review of Laplacian applications appears in [D. Spielman's ICM 2010 paper http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/PAPERS/icm10post.pdf].

Laplacian matrices of graphs arise in 
  * Large-scale computational applications such as machine learning
  * Spectral clustering of images, genetic data and web pages
  * Transportation network flows; electrical resistor circuits
  * Elliptic partial differential equations discretized on unstructured grids with finite elements. 

The LAMG code was demonstrated to scale linearly for a diverse set of 1666 real-world graphs with up to six million edges.
