= Downloading and Installing =

LAMG comes with an extensive testing collection of over 1700 real-world graph instances with up to about 10 million edges, collected from the following sources:
  * The [http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/matrices/ University of Florida Sparse Matrix collection (UF)] by Tim Davis.
  * [http://staffweb.cms.gre.ac.uk/~wc06/partition/ C. Walshaw's] graph partitioning archive.
  * I. Safro's [http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~safro/mloga.html MLogA results archive] at Argonne National Laboratory.
  * The FTP site of the [http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/Challenges/ DIMACS Implementation Challenges].
Each source except UF corresponds to a zip file in the [http://code.google.com/p/lamg/downloads/list Downloads] section that has been converted to the LAMG input format. The UF collection is obtained from the UF server via the `ufget` API.

  * *Step 1:* [http://code.google.com/p/lamg/wiki/Installation Download and install] the LAMG code.
  * *Step 2:* In your `config.txt` file, set a `mat_dir` appropriate for your system (linux uses slashes; windows uses backslashes in dir paths). This directory will contain all graph data.
  * *Step 3:* Download all Test-Instance archive files (ml.zip, walshaw.zip, ...) from the [http://code.google.com/p/lamg/downloads/list Downloads] section. Unzip the files into `mat_dir`.
  * *Step 4:* Download and convert the UF collection to LAMG format: at the MATLAB prompt, type
  {{{
  graphConvert(0, 6e6, {'uf'}, '');
  }}}
This downloads all symmetric UF graph instances with 0 to 6 million edges into `mat_dir/uf`. The maximum number of edges should match the amount of RAM you have on your machine. If you had unlimited RAM, you could use `Inf` as the second argument of ```graphConvert```.
